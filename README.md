# Blind75 + Neetcode 150?
My solutions for the Blind 75 problems in C++

Organized based on topics

Bro in code: https://github.com/kruthirajeshwar/Blind75/tree/main

# Day 1
Tackled one easy and one medium problem - twoSum and longestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters
Learnt important concepts of Hashmaps/Sliding Window -> unordered_map/unordered_set in C++ and its internal functions.

# Day 2
Tackled 2 easy problems - validAnagrams and containsDuplicate -> relatively easy; didn't explore alternate solutions, for ex using sorting instead

# Day 3
Tackled one difficult problem - groupAnagrams - Explored two different approaches - one with sorting and one with counting the frequency of occurance.
